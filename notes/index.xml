The minimum races in a season is 8 and must take place on at least 3 continents.</description></item><item><title>Information technology</title><link>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/information-technology/nav/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/information-technology/nav/</guid><description> [[Linux]] [[Windows]] [[Mac]] [[BSD]] [[Networking]]</description></item><item><title>INFOSEC</title><link>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/INFOSEC/background/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/INFOSEC/background/</guid><description>Background Information Security (INFOSEC), often referred to as Cybersecurity or Cyber is the practice of defending information systems (computers/servers) and networks. The term INFOSEC started in the US Military as a counterpart to the other security disciplines: [[PERSEC]] (Personnel), [[PHYSEC]] (Physical), (Communications), and [[OPSEC]] (Operations).
While the military views these as distinct entities, modern INFOSEC programs incorporate all of the disciplines.
