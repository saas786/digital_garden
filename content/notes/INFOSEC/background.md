# Background

Information Security (INFOSEC), often referred to as Cybersecurity or Cyber is the practice of defending information systems (computers/servers) and networks. The term INFOSEC started in the US Military as a counterpart to the other security disciplines: [PERSEC](PERSEC) (Personnel), [PHYSEC](PHYSEC) (Physical), (Communications), and [OPSEC](OPSEC) (Operations). 

While the military views these as distinct entities, modern INFOSEC programs incorporate all of the disciplines. Monitoring and controlling physical access and the personnel able to access them is key, as well as controlling what information for access is publicly available to prevent compromise.

Information Security is often broken up into color coded sections:
- [Blue](Blue)
- [Red](Red)
- [Yellow](Yellow)
- [White](White)

The creation of these color-coded teams once again comes from the military. Traditionally, in training exercises, the military will split their units into a "red cell" and "blue cell" to practice against each other. These colors became handy when INFOSEC people wanted to delineate offensive capabilities like [Penetration Testing](Penetration-Testing) and defensive capabilities like [Incident Response](Incident-Response)
