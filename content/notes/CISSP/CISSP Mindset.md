### Your role is a risk advisor -- DO NOT FIX PROBLEMS
Ex:
```
Q: Kelly has been employed with the company for 12 months and has been a difficult employee. She is being terminated at 10am on Friday. What should you do at 10am on Friday?

A: Ensure proper policies and procedures are in place to terminate employees.
```

### Who is accountable (ultimate responsibility) for security?
Where does the buck end? Senior management. We are all responsible. But ultimate responsibility rests on senior management.

---
### How much security is enough?
You CAN have too much. Protect assets without having costs so high that they exceed your assets.

Consider:
1. Performance
2. Cost
3. Ease-of-use

---
### All decisions start with risk management. Risk management starts with identification and valuation of your assets.
Consider likelihood and cost of countermeasure.

---
### If all questions seem good, revisit the question.

---
### Think "End Game"
Which answer takes you all the way through to the point that you've satisfied your objectives?

Ex:
```
Q: Why do we train people?

1. To raise security awareness
2. To modify behavior

A: To modify behavior
```

### "Security Transcends Technology"
It doesn't matter how much money you spend on a firewall if you don't have inherent security practices in place. Focus first on security principles, then add the technology.

---
### Physical safety is always the first choice.
Any time you have a question and one of the options would protect human lives over others, that is the choice to make.

---
### Technical questions are for managers. Management questions are for technicians.
---
### Incorporate security into design, as opposed to adding on later.
---
### Layered Defense!
