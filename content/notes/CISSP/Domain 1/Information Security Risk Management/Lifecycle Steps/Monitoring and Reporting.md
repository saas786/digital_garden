# Monitoring and Reporting

- A risk response is designed and implemented based on a risk assessment that was conducted at a single point in time.
- Because of the changing nature of risk and associated controls, ongoing monitoring is an essential step of the risk management life cycle.
	- Controls can become less effective
	- The operational environment may change and new threats, technologies and vulnerabilities may emerge.

Tools used to determine if goals are met are [Key Risk Indicators](Key-Risk-Indicators).
