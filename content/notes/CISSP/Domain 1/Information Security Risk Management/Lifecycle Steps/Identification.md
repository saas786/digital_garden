# Identification

### Alignment with Business Goals and Objectives
- The first and most import step for a CISSP is to understand the business. Review organizational vision and strategy **FIRST**.
- Look beyond IT -- Risk is measured by the impact the risk has on the business, not on a particular system.
- In order for risk to be integrated into the enterprise, senior management must be supportive and involved.
	- If management funds and supports the risk management process, we will have what we need to be successful.
	- Good metrics mean that we have attainable objectives, which will help us accomplish our goals.
	- Good communication and transparency helps us make risk-aware business decisions

### Risk Identification
- [AV](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Asset%20Value) \* [Threat](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Threat) \* [Vulnerability](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Vulnerability) = [Risk](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Risk)
- This may also appear as [AV](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Asset%20Value) \* [Threat](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Threat) \* [Vulnerability](notes/CISSP/Domain%201/Information%20Security%20Risk%20Management/Definitions/Vulnerability)
- At this stage, risks are ONLY being identified
- Often this is the step where a risk register begins to be populated
