# Mitigation

### Risk Reduction/Avoidance

- [Risk](../Definitions/Risk) reduction means the action is taken to lessen the frequency and/or impact of a risk.
	- May require the use of several [controls](../Definitions/Control) until it reaches levels of risk acceptance or risk tolerance.

- Examples of risk mitigation:
	- Strengthening overall risk management practices, such as implementing sufficiently mature risk management processes.
	- Deploying new technical, management or operational controls that reduce either the likelihood or the impact of an adverse event.
	- Installing a new access control system
	- Implementing policies or operational procedures
	- Developing an effective incident response and business continuity plan (BCP)
	- Using compensating controls.

### Risk Transference
- Risk transference is a decision to reduce loss through sharing that risk with another organization.
- SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and contracts establish the degree of transference.
- Remember: You can't transfer liability.

### Risk Acceptance
- When it is no longer cost effective to mitigate/transfer. Tolerable amount of risk.
