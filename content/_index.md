Good day and welcome to my digital garden. 

A digital garden is a mix of a wiki, blog, and notes. The concept of a digital garden is that, unlike a blog, nothing is timestamped or finished, all portions of this are evergreen and are updated frequently. There is no set start or end, you can enter at any portion of this and leave when you wish.

If you want help navigating this site, there is a node graph at the bottom right and a list of backlinks on the bottom left.

There are a few subjects I take notes about frequently:
- [[security]]
- [[information technology]]
- [[programming]]
- [[sports]]

I hope you have fun! You can leave any issues you have with this project on the GitHub repository found [here](https://github.com/deemonsecurity/digital_garden).
