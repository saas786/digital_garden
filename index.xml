The term INFOSEC started in the US Military as a counterpart to the other security disciplines: PERSEC (Personnel), PHYSEC (Physical), (Communications), and OPSEC (Operations).
While the military views these as distinct entities, modern INFOSEC programs incorporate all of the disciplines. Monitoring and controlling physical access and the personnel able to access them is key, as well as controlling what information for access is publicly available to prevent compromise.</description></item><item><title>Integrity</title><link>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/CISSP/Domain-1/Triad/Integrity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.deemonsecurity.com/notes/CISSP/Domain-1/Triad/Integrity/</guid><description>Integrity Integrity is upheld when the assurance of the accuracy and reliability of information and systems is provided and any unauthorized modification is prevented.
